# IDD — PR Submit Phase (D)

Read this file after the self-review loop passes. It covers
pre-publication development-branch sync, claim verification, tests,
pushing, PR creation, and waiting for CI.

Before the D1 sync and D2 push, apply the
[shared claim revalidation gate](idd-overview-core.instructions.md#claim-revalidation-gate).
`{development-branch}` below is the value resolved in
`idd-work.instructions.md`'s B1
[Resolve the development branch](idd-work.instructions.md#b1--create-worktree-with-branch)
step — re-resolve it here if this file is entered directly (for
example, on resume) without a fresh B1 pass.

## D1 — Sync {development-branch} before first push

If the branch has not been pushed yet, sync it onto `{development-branch}`
before the first push — the routine pre-publication history cleanup step.
First run `git fetch origin {development-branch}`, then check whether the
branch is **already current** with `origin/{development-branch}`: if
`git merge-base HEAD origin/{development-branch}` equals
`origin/{development-branch}` (behind-count 0), the branch already
contains every commit on `{development-branch}`, so the rebase would be a
pure no-op. **Skip the rebase entirely and proceed to D2** — D1's
pre-publication synchronization goal is already met. In a
sibling-worktree setup a no-op `git rebase origin/{development-branch}`
can still detach HEAD at the upstream tip without replaying the local
commit, and re-running that no-op rebase re-detaches every time, so the
bounded recovery below cannot converge for the no-op case; skipping it is
the clean exit.

Otherwise the branch **is** behind `origin/{development-branch}`: rebase
it onto `{development-branch}` (`git rebase origin/{development-branch}`),
then apply the post-rebase verification and bounded recovery below.

After the first D-phase push, do not reuse D1 as the normal
synchronization path. Later branch updates should return through the
E-phase review loop and, by default, merge `{development-branch}` into
the published PR branch so the synchronization diff is reviewable.

This D-phase file records the publication boundary only: post-push
synchronization itself runs through `idd-review-triage.instructions.md`'s
E-phase branch-sync check (`Esync`), which uses the
`branch-conflict-state` helper when helper runtime is enabled (a
`gh pr view` fallback otherwise), and `idd-resume.instructions.md`
already routes a content-conflict branch there on restart.

If D1 itself reveals content conflicts before the first push, resolve
them and continue the rebase. After completing the rebase, if any files
were manually edited during conflict resolution, run **fix-validate**
and commit any resulting changes before proceeding.

On a signed-commit repo whose primary signing is non-interactive-hostile
(GPG pinentry or a hardware-touch path) but that provides a fallback
signing wrapper for arbitrary git subcommands (pass
`-c gpg.format=ssh -c user.signingkey=<abs-path> -c commit.gpgsign=true`
to `git` before the subcommand — `git -c … rebase`, not `git rebase -c …`
— or use a repo alias that wraps any subcommand; a commit-only alias like
`git commit-ssh` will not run `rebase`),
**run the initial `git rebase origin/{development-branch}` above
through that wrapper — not the plain command — and continue it with
the wrapper's own
`--continue` form**; the wrapper must own the whole operation. Plain
`git rebase --continue` re-signs the replayed commit through the
configured primary signing, which stalls non-interactively right after
the conflict is already resolved. This is the normal-path complement to
the recovery-path re-signing in Post-rebase verification below.

### Post-rebase verification

In a sibling-worktree setup, a rebase can leave HEAD **detached at the
upstream tip without replaying the local commit**: the branch ref is
preserved, but HEAD is moved off it. After the rebase completes and before
D2, verify both:

1. `git branch --show-current` is **non-empty** — HEAD is on the claimed
   branch, not detached.
2. The expected local commit is present in
   `origin/{development-branch}..HEAD` (for example, `git log --oneline
   origin/{development-branch}..HEAD` lists it) — `origin/`-prefixed
   since a local `{development-branch}` branch may not exist.

If HEAD is detached (current branch empty), **auto-recover once**: re-attach
to the claimed branch with `git checkout {branch-name}` (the local commit is
preserved on the branch ref), re-run the D1 rebase, then re-verify both
checks. The re-rebase re-signs through the configured commit-signing path —
do not hardcode an ad-hoc key. On the signed-commit repos in the rebase
note above, run the re-rebase through that same fallback wrapper (the
repo's blessed fallback, not an ad-hoc pin), since the plain re-rebase
would stall on the non-interactive primary signing. If
recovery still fails (HEAD still detached or the
expected commit absent), post a hold note documenting the branch state and
stop; do not push.

This is the same divergence the shared
[claim revalidation gate](idd-overview-core.instructions.md#claim-revalidation-gate)
catches at the next mutation (current branch ≠ claimed branch); detecting it
here turns a confusing later failure into an immediate, recoverable signal.

## D2 — Verify claim, lint, test, push

1. Re-read the issue to confirm the claim is still yours: the **active
   claim** must still use your current `{claim-id}`. If the active claim
   is missing, released, or held by a different `{claim-id}` (even under
   the same agent ID), the claim was lost — report this and stop.
2. Run **pre-push-validate**.

   (E2E tests are verified by CI; do not run them locally.)

   The same conservative scoping discretion as post-fix re-validation
   (`idd-ci.instructions.md`'s Wake-up discipline) applies here: skip an
   individual command in the chain only when the diff's changed paths
   provably fall entirely outside that command's input surface, never
   as a default shortcut. Run the full chain whenever that exclusion
   cannot be established.
3. Push the branch to the remote. On the first publication push, use a
   normal push. If you are recovering an already-published branch under
   an explicit force-push exception, use `--force-with-lease` only when
   repository policy permits it and the exceptional route already
   required a rebase; otherwise stop and return to the merge-based sync
   path.

Once the branch is pushed, treat it as published review history. A PR
that is merely `BEHIND` does not force a branch update by itself unless
branch protection or explicit repository policy requires an up-to-date
head before merge.

## D3 — Create PR

Before drafting the PR body, check whether the repository defines
`.github/pull_request_template.md`. If it exists, shape the PR body to
follow that template's section structure from the start, rather than
drafting free-form text and reconciling it against the template
afterward — repository review tooling (for example, CodeRabbit's
default description check) can compare the PR description against
that template when present, and a mismatched body can trigger an
avoidable advisory finding. If no template file exists, use the
structure below directly.

Use GH CLI or GH MCP to create the pull request, targeting
`{development-branch}` explicitly (`gh pr create --base
{development-branch} …` or the MCP equivalent) — do not rely on the
tool's own default-branch fallback, which resolves to the repository's
default branch and silently mistargets the PR whenever
`{development-branch}` differs from it.

**Inherited claim or resume**: if an existing PR already exists for this
branch (takeover, resume) or an inherited claim otherwise names an open
PR, verify its base branch (`gh pr view <pr-number> --json baseRefName`)
equals `{development-branch}` before continuing. A mismatch is a
**wrong-base PR**: stop and post a hold comment rather than editing the
base or proceeding — a base-branch change can silently rewrite the
PR's diff and history against the wrong target.

The PR body must include the following content, mapped onto the
template's sections when one exists:

- A concise summary of the branch's changes
- A closing keyword on its own line linking the claimed issue (see
  Closing keyword below)
- Recommended follow-up issues (if any)
- Relevant background/rationale, when it materially affects review (for
  example, reuse constraints, intentional trade-offs, or non-goals).
  Include only context grounded in the issue discussion, commits, diff,
  or explicit operator instructions; omit rather than speculate.

**Do not create follow-up issues directly.** An executing IDD session
must never call `gh issue create` (or the REST issues API) itself.
Recommended follow-ups stay in the PR body's own prose above. If a
follow-up is important enough to file in-repo now, invoke the
`issue-authoring` skill (its Stage 1 hold) instead of improvising a
body. Do not add a parallel "worker-lite authoring" contract.

### D3.6 — Derive the IDD impact checklist

Skip this sub-step and D3.7 below entirely when
`.github/pull_request_template.md` does not exist or has no `IDD
impact` heading — mirroring D3's own "If no template file exists, use
the structure below directly" fallback, there is no checklist to
derive or reconcile. When it exists, `.github/pull_request_template.md`'s
IDD impact checklist (`Instruction files changed` / `Template files
changed` / `Helper scripts changed` / `Config schema changed` /
`Security / credential / merge behavior changed`) is drafted from the
branch's actual changed-file list, not from memory. Before drafting the
body, list the branch's changes
(`git diff --name-only origin/{development-branch}...HEAD`) and derive
each checkbox mechanically, using a root-anchored path-prefix match
(the path starts with the glob's literal prefix, not merely contains
it):

- **Instruction files changed** — any path starting with
  `.github/instructions/` (excludes `idd-template/.github/instructions/`
  paths, which count only under Template files below).
- **Template files changed** — any path starting with `idd-template/`.
- **Helper scripts changed** — any path starting with `src/scripts/`,
  `scripts/`, or `bin/`.
- **Config schema changed** — `audit/sync-manifest.json`,
  `.github/idd/config.json`, or another repository-designated
  config-schema-bearing file.
- **Security / credential / merge behavior changed** stays a judgment
  call — leave it to ordinary self-review discretion; it is not
  mechanically derivable from paths alone.

D3.7 below re-derives this same checklist against the final HEAD before
merge — later commits (a review-fix round, a critique-pass fix landed
before the first push) can change the answer.

### PR body language

The PR body's prose sections above (summary, background/rationale,
follow-up notes) follow the resolved `authoringLanguage` value from
`.github/idd/config.json`: a fixed language tag when configured, the
claimed issue's own body language when the value is `match-source`
(this file's unattended-execution case, with no live operator), or
English when the field is absent. See the
[Authoring Language](../../docs/customization.md#authoring-language)
section for the full field definition.

This never changes a machine-parsed marker or an exact-regex-matched
visible line, which always stays in its canonical form regardless of
`authoringLanguage`. Concretely here, the closing keyword line below
(`Closes #N` and its variants) must keep its exact English keyword
form: GitHub's own closing-keyword parser and this file's D3.5
verification regex both match only the English keyword forms
(`close[sd]?`/`fix(e[sd])?`/`resolve[sd]?`), so translating that line
would silently break auto-close detection.

### Closing keyword

The closing keyword must appear in the PR **body** (not the title) as
plain markdown text. Write a line such as Closes #N, Fixes #N, or
Resolves #N (case-insensitive) where N is the claimed issue number.
Render that example literally in the body — no backticks, no code
fences, no block-quote prefix.

When referring to keyword forms _as forms_ (not as the literal body
text), inline code is fine in surrounding prose; the no-wrapper
constraint applies only to the actual PR body content that GitHub
must parse.

GitHub recognizes the following keyword forms: close, closes, closed,
fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved. GitHub's merge-time
detection reads these same forms in the branch's commit messages too,
not only the PR body — see Mirror false-positive below for the
structural-separation rule that covers both surfaces.

#### Anti-patterns

GitHub's closing-keyword detection does NOT activate when the keyword
is wrapped in any of these markdown forms — even if the underlying
text is correct:

- inline code (backtick-wrapped, e.g. `` `Closes #1` ``) — not
  detected
- fenced code block (triple backtick or triple tilde) — not detected
- block quote prefix (`>` at line start) — not detected

When detection fails, GitHub will not auto-close the linked issue on
merge and the issue↔PR linking surfaces (sidebar, timeline) will not
populate.

**Mirror false-positive — negation-blind detection**: the same literal
matching runs in the other direction too, and it is not limited to the
PR body — GitHub's merge-time scan reads the same recognized keyword
forms in the branch's commit messages (subject and body) as well.
GitHub's detector matches a recognized keyword form immediately
adjacent to a `#N` reference and has no concept of negation —
wrapping the keyword in surrounding "not" / "deliberately" / "isn't"
wording does not stop detection when the keyword itself still sits
next to the `#N` it must not close, whether that text lives in the PR
body or in a commit message. Keep every recognized keyword form
(`close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`, `resolve`,
`resolves`, `resolved`) structurally apart from any reference it must
not close, in both locations:

- Risky — a keyword sits directly before the reference, even inside a
  negation clause, whether in the PR body or a commit message: "this
  PR does not close #42" (`close` is immediately adjacent to `#42`;
  GitHub cannot see the "not").
- Safe — reorder so no recognized keyword is adjacent to the
  reference: "Refs #42 (deliberately not a closing keyword — see the
  discussion there for why this PR does not resolve it directly)".
  Here `resolve` is followed by "it", not a `#N` token, so nothing
  adjacent to `#42` matches. The same reordering works verbatim inside
  a commit subject or body.

Do not rely on careful phrasing alone as the only safeguard — the
strengthened checks in D3.5 below verify `closingIssuesReferences`
against the deliberate closing set exactly and scan the branch's own
commit messages, catching a spurious extra close even if phrasing
slips.

#### Multiple closing issues

When the PR closes more than one issue, repeat the keyword for each
reference. Both keywords must appear in plain body text for GitHub to
auto-close both issues:

- Works — a body line written as Closes #1, closes #2 (GitHub parses
  each keyword + reference pair).
- Does **not** work — a body line written as Closes #1, #2 (no
  keyword precedes the second reference, so #2 is not auto-closed).

After creating the PR, if the repository has CODEOWNER rules or expected
reviewers that are not auto-assigned by GitHub, request them explicitly:

```sh
gh pr edit {pr-number} --add-reviewer {reviewer-login}
```

### D3.5 — Verify closing keyword detection

**Non-default development branch**: GitHub only auto-closes a linked
issue when the merging PR targets the repository's **default** branch
— a closing keyword on a PR based on any other branch, including a
configured `{development-branch}`, never populates
`closingIssuesReferences` and never auto-closes on merge, regardless of
body wording. When `{development-branch}` is not the repository's
default branch, still include the closing keyword line in the PR body
for reviewer clarity, but **skip this entire sub-step** (steps 1-7
below verify a mechanism that cannot fire here) and close the claimed
issue explicitly after F3 merges (`idd-merge.instructions.md` F4 notes
this).

After PR creation and before D4, confirm GitHub recognized the
closing keyword for the claimed issue. Resume routing should re-enter
this sub-step when a session restarts after PR creation but before CI
completion.

1. Re-fetch the PR body:

   ```sh
   gh pr view <pr-number> --json body --jq '.body'
   ```

2. Strip regions GitHub does not parse for closing keywords:

   - lines inside fenced code blocks (triple backtick or triple tilde)
   - spans inside inline code (single backticks)
   - lines beginning with `>` (block-quote prefix) after leading
     whitespace

3. Search the remaining plain-text body for a closing keyword
   referencing the **claimed issue number** `<N>`, using a regex
   equivalent to:

   ```text
   (?im)\b(close[sd]?|fix(e[sd])?|resolve[sd]?)\s+#<N>\b
   ```

4. **If no match in the stripped body**:

   - Edit the PR body with
     `gh pr edit <pr-number> --body <updated-body>` to add a
     correctly placed plain-text closing keyword line (e.g.,
     `Closes #<N>` as its own line, outside any code fence or
     block quote).
   - Repeat steps 1–3 once.
   - If the second self-check still fails, post a hold note on the
     issue citing the PR URL and stop. Do not proceed to D4.

5. **If the keyword exists only inside a stripped region**: report
   which wrapper form was detected (inline code, fenced block, or
   block-quote prefix) and apply the same edit-and-recheck path
   as step 4.

6. **Confirm the closing set matches exactly**: GitHub's
   `closingIssuesReferences` field on the PR
   (`gh pr view <pr-number> --json closingIssuesReferences --jq
   '.closingIssuesReferences[].number'`) lists every issue GitHub plans
   to close when the PR merges. Compare it against the deliberate
   closing set from D3 — normally just the claimed issue `<N>`, or the
   full deliberate multi-issue set when "Multiple closing issues" above
   applies. The two sets must be **exactly** equal; steps 1-5 above
   only confirm the claimed issue `<N>` is present, so this step is the
   only one that catches either direction of mismatch:

   - **An extra entry** (a `closingIssuesReferences` issue outside the
     deliberate set) is most often the negation-blind false-positive
     documented above, where an unrelated `#M` reference ends up
     adjacent to a recognized keyword elsewhere in the body. Edit the
     PR body to separate the keyword from that `#M` reference.
   - **A missing entry** (a deliberate multi-issue-close target absent
     from `closingIssuesReferences`) means its keyword did not
     register — apply the same edit-and-recheck path as step 4 for
     that issue number.

   Repeat this step once after either fix. If it still fails, post a
   hold note on the issue citing the PR URL and stop. Do not proceed to
   D4.

7. **Scan the branch's own commit messages**: GitHub's merge-time
   closing-keyword scan also reads commit messages (subject and body),
   not only the PR body, so a stray keyword there can auto-close an
   issue outside the deliberate set even when the PR body is clean.
   List the branch's own commits, using a visible delimiter rather
   than a NUL byte so common terminals and search tools don't treat
   the output as binary:

   ```sh
   git log origin/{development-branch}..HEAD --pretty=format:'%H%n%B%n===commit-boundary==='
   ```

   For each commit's full message, search using step 3's same keyword
   alternation, generalized to any issue number instead of the fixed
   `<N>`:

   ```text
   (?im)\b(close[sd]?|fix(e[sd])?|resolve[sd]?)\s+#(\d+)\b
   ```

   A match against any issue number in the deliberate closing set from
   D3 is expected (deliberate — this covers both the single-issue `<N>`
   case and "Multiple closing issues" above); only a captured number
   **outside** that set is a stray commit-message close.

   **On a stray match**: amend the offending commit (`git commit
   --amend` for the tip commit, or an interactive rebase for an
   earlier one) using the same safe reordering as the Mirror
   false-positive example above. If the branch already carries a merge
   commit (for example, from an E-phase `{development-branch}` sync), rebase with
   `--rebase-merges` instead of a plain interactive rebase, so the
   merge and its recorded conflict resolution aren't silently
   linearized or dropped. On a signed-commit repo whose primary
   signing is non-interactive-hostile, run the amend or rebase through
   the same D1 fallback-signing wrapper noted above, including any
   rebase continuation — the plain command can stall the same way D1
   already documents. Then force-push the correction (`git push
   --force-with-lease`) only when repository policy permits
   force-pushing a published branch, mirroring D2's own force-push
   restriction; if it does not, hold for operator intervention instead
   of rewriting published history. **Amend before merge** — this scan
   runs at merge time, so the fix must land before the PR merges; a
   commit message caught only after merge cannot be amended, and
   recovery requires reopening the affected issue by hand. Repeat this
   step once after the amendment. If it still finds a stray match,
   post a hold note on the issue citing the PR URL and stop. Do not
   proceed to D4.

   **Re-run before merge**: this scan only covers commits present at
   D3.5 time. Later branch commits — accepted review fixes
   (`idd-review-fix.instructions.md` E9-E12) or a `{development-branch}`
   merge — are not automatically covered; re-run this step against the final HEAD
   before F3 merges.

### D3.7 — Re-verify the IDD impact checklist before merge

Immediately before F3 merge (the same "re-run before merge" point as
D3.5 step 7 above), re-derive D3.6's checklist against the final HEAD's
full changed-file list and compare it against the PR body's current
checked boxes. When a ratchet-rule-bearing file (for example,
`audit/sync-manifest.json`'s own ratchet-rule comment) raises a
documented budget or limit anywhere in the branch's commits, also
confirm the file's required PR-description callout is actually present
in the body now, not only in a commit message — a callout only
promised at draft time and never landed is the same drift this step
exists to catch.

On any mismatch: re-run the claim revalidation gate immediately before
editing (a separate mutation, not covered by an earlier gated push),
fetch the PR's current full body, edit only the checklist section (and
the accompanying file-list prose, when present) in the fetched copy,
and post the complete result back — `gh pr edit {pr-number} --body-file
<path>` replaces the whole body, so never pass a partial file, which
would drop the closing-keyword line and every other section. After
posting, repeat D3.5 step 6's closing-set check when D3.5 applies to
this branch (skip it on the same non-default-`{development-branch}`
condition D3.5 itself skips under, where `closingIssuesReferences`
never populates and the check would be meaningless) — edited prose can
otherwise introduce a stray keyword-adjacent reference.

**Known gap**: no phase file currently re-invokes D3.5 or this step by
name from F1-F3, so this re-check depends on the same implicit trigger
D3.5 step 7 already relies on rather than an explicit F-phase call —
out of this step's own scope to close; recommend a follow-up issue to
wire an explicit F2/F3 trigger if this gap is not already tracked.

## D4 — Wait for CI

Schedule a wake, or background this wait only if the
topology-safety condition holds (confirmed to route completion back to
this turn); otherwise wait synchronously — block with:

- `gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status` (single workflow run; not
  usable on a fine-grained PAT)
- `gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch --required` (PR required-check
  rollup)

See [idd-ci.instructions.md's Wake-up
discipline](idd-ci.instructions.md#wake-up-discipline) for the
caveats on both. Do not `run_in_background` this wait absent the
confirmed condition above. Delegate polling mechanics to
`idd-ci.instructions.md`.

- **On success** → proceed to `idd-review-snapshot.instructions.md`
- **`idd-advisory-convergence` is the sole non-pass required check, and
  its own verdict — a JSON object printed in that check's run log, whose
  `pending` field is distinct from any GitHub check-run status —
  reports `pending: false` with outstanding review reasons** (thread
  disposition, actionable item count on the latest review, or
  both; see `idd-ci.instructions.md` §Interpretation for this shared
  trigger condition) → this is not a CI-wait state: the
  check turns green only after E-phase disposition, which is downstream
  of D4, so continued polling cannot resolve it, and a
  `ciWait.rerunPolicy` rerun only reproduces the same red **unless a
  maintainer has since posted a valid external-check waiver for this
  HEAD** — that case still needs the rerun, to make the check reflect
  the waiver (a pre-existing F2/F3 concern this branch leaves unchanged;
  see `idd-pre-merge.instructions.md`'s External-check waivers). A
  waiver is effective only once `deadline.passed` is true or
  `terminal.state` reaches `COPILOT_UNAVAILABLE` (check both fields in
  the same run's output); posted earlier, it is valid but inert —
  mechanically the same as no waiver until then. Absent a waiver, or
  with one still inert, exit CI-wait and proceed directly to
  `idd-review-snapshot.instructions.md` (E1) instead, matching the phase
  routing table's "PR open, CI running, reviews exist" row. This does
  not relax the merge gate — the check stays required, and F2
  re-verifies it independently before merge.
- **`idd-advisory-convergence` is the sole non-pass required check, and
  its own verdict reports `pending: true`** (e.g. "Copilot has not
  reviewed this pull request yet") → the literal opposite boolean value
  from the carve-out above: the check evaluated before Copilot's
  asynchronous review exists for this HEAD SHA at all. This is an
  expected, self-resolving timing race, not a code-caused failure and
  not the review-disposition state above — but "not already outstanding"
  is the wrong test on its own: `SATISFIED`, `WAIT`, and `CAP_EXHAUSTED`
  can all read as "not outstanding" too (`idd-skill#2622`). Run the
  [canonical `advisory-wait-state`
  invocation](idd-advisory-wait.instructions.md#1-canonical-path-helper-first)
  for this PR first and read `outcome`: only `REQUEST_NEEDED` means
  request a review now. `SATISFIED` (`lastCopilotCommit` already
  matches this HEAD SHA — Copilot's review already covers it) or `WAIT`
  (a same-head request already exists, still inside its settle window)
  both mean request nothing — wait for Copilot's review to land for the
  current HEAD SHA (already true in the `SATISFIED` case), then rerun
  via `rerun-advisory-convergence.mjs` (see `idd-ci.instructions.md`
  §Rerun mechanics) and resume D4. `CAP_EXHAUSTED` (the request cap is
  already spent) or `RECOVERY_NEEDED` (a proven same-head request
  exists but needs its marker, not a new request) both need the fuller
  AW3 handling this bullet does not reimplement — exit CI-wait and
  proceed directly to `idd-review-snapshot.instructions.md` (E1)
  instead, the same carve-out the pending-disposition case above takes.
