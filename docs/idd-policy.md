# IDD Policy Configuration

This repository uses the Issue-Driven Development (IDD) workflow
imported from
[`kurone-kito/idd-skill`](https://github.com/kurone-kito/idd-skill).
This page records the eleven policy decisions confirmed during the
onboarding flow (roadmap #95). The machine-readable mirror lives at
[`.github/idd/config.json`](../.github/idd/config.json); keep both in
sync when the policy changes.

The schema name for each field below comes from
[`docs/onboarding/policy-decisions.md`](./onboarding/policy-decisions.md)
so future IDD sessions can navigate between the human-readable record
and the upstream template without surprises.

## Merge Policy

**Policy**: `fully_autonomous_merge`

One trusted agent session may continue through the F2.5 / F3 handoff
gate after the normal claim, freshness, CI, advisory, and review gates
pass. The repository is single-maintainer, so worker credentials and
merge-capable credentials are intentionally the same scope; see the
[Credential Scope](#credential-scope) section for the explicit
boundary.

## PR Review Policy

**Profile**: `copilot-advisory` (distributed default).

GitHub Copilot is requested after review-fix pushes and before merge
freshness checks; it provides advisory state only. The repository
already wires CodeRabbit through
[`.coderabbit.yaml`](../.coderabbit.yaml) — both reviewers coexist.
Confirm Copilot Code Review is enabled in repository settings before
the first unattended run; if it is not, migrate to the `external-bot`
profile pointed at CodeRabbit and follow the edit-surface checklist
in [`docs/idd-review-policy-profiles.md`](./idd-review-policy-profiles.md).

## Review-Thread Resolution Policy

**Policy**: `fast-agent-resolve` (distributed default).

After an agent accepts and fixes feedback, rejects it with a recorded
rationale, or handles PATH B advisory feedback, the agent may resolve
the associated thread. This means "the agent acted on the thread", not
"the reviewer agreed". Suitable for the parallel-IDD goal because it
keeps the loop high-throughput.

## Critique-Loop Profile

**Profile**: distributed defaults from
[`docs/policy-constants.md`](./policy-constants.md). No repository
override.

## Claim Timing

- **`claim-stale-age`**: `12h` (shortened from the `24h` distributed
  default).
- **`claim-heartbeat-interval`**: `6h` (shortened from the `12h`
  distributed default).

Rationale: this repository runs lightweight CI (cspell, markdownlint,
bats, Pester, lua syntax). Stale-claim takeover cost is low because a
single maintainer can revalidate quickly, so a tighter clock keeps
parallel sessions from leaving idle claims sitting around half a day.

## CI Wait Policy

- **`ciWait.runningTimeout`**: `PT10M` (shortened from the `PT30M`
  distributed default).
- **`ciWait.generationTimeout`**: `PT10M` (distributed default).
- **`ciWait.rerunPolicy`**: `rerun-once` (distributed default).

Rationale: the longest CI job in this repo currently finishes in
~1 minute, so a 10-minute running timeout is generous without
stretching the loop wait. Keep the rerun policy on `rerun-once` to
absorb the occasional transient failure without re-running indefinitely.

## Credential Scope

- **Worker credentials**: maintainer-equivalent (`kurone-kito` repo
  access — read/write to issues, PRs, branches, commits).
- **Merge-capable credentials**: identical to worker credentials.

The single-maintainer topology intentionally collapses these two
scopes. Flag this section before any split-authority migration —
introducing `separate_merge_agent` later would require splitting the
credential model first.

## Helper Runtime Profile

**Profile**: `ephemeral-npx`.

The discover, suitability, review-snapshot, advisory-wait, and
pre-merge phases may invoke
`npx --yes --package <reviewed-helper-spec> idd-helper-bundle-manifest`
when a reviewed helper spec is available. The companion prerequisite
issue #96 pins Node.js 24.15.0 via project-local
[`.tool-versions`](../.tool-versions) / [`.node-version`](../.node-version) /
[`.nvmrc`](../.nvmrc) so `npx` always resolves in a fresh worktree.

## Issue-Author Approval Gate

- **Gate posture**: `opted-out`.
- **`skipIssueAuthorApprovalGate`**: `true` (machine-readable mirror in
  [`.github/idd/config.json`](../.github/idd/config.json)).
- **`maintainer-approval-actors` policy**:
  `owners-and-maintainers-only` (recorded for future re-enablement;
  moot while the gate is opted out).
- **Approval signals**: not exercised while the gate is opted out.
- **`approvalSignals.readyLabelName`**: not configured (default `idd:ready`
  would apply if the gate is re-enabled later).
- **`approvalSignals.labelFreshnessMode`**: not configured (default
  `presence-only` would apply if the gate is re-enabled later).
- **Missing-approval behavior**: gate inactive — explicit-target runs
  and discovery may proceed without an approval signal.

Rationale: this is a single-maintainer dotfiles repository. The
issue-author approval gate exists to keep unattended agents from
auto-picking up issues filed by strangers; with only the maintainer
filing issues, the gate is overhead. Re-enable it (and create the
`idd:ready` label) before opening this repository to multi-author
collaboration.

## Issue-Authoring Companion

- **Status**: `installed` at `.claude/skills/issue-authoring/`.
- **`issueAuthoring.maxClarificationRounds`**: `3` (distributed
  default).

The companion drafts IDD-ready issues and roadmaps before the normal
Discover loop starts. See its
[bundled contract](../.claude/skills/issue-authoring/references/contract.md)
for the readiness buckets, output chooser, and approval boundary.

## Open follow-ups

These items were recorded during onboarding as **deferred** or
**needs-decision**; they do not block the current IDD execution loop
but should be revisited when the surrounding policy moves.

- _(deferred)_ Add a dedicated `idd-task.yml` issue template under
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` so future IDD-driven issues use a stable
  shape. The issue-authoring companion already produces a valid shape
  without a template.
- _(deferred)_ Create the `idd:ready` and `status:authoring`
  repository labels. With the approval gate opted out and publication
  routed through the user, neither label is exercised on the
  ready-execution side. Add them only if a stricter posture is
  adopted later.
- _(deferred)_ Promote `lint.yml` and `test.yml` to **required status
  checks** on the `master` branch protection. Today neither workflow
  is required, so `fully_autonomous_merge` proceeds without a CI gate.
  Promoting them would tighten the merge floor before any unattended
  run.
- _(needs-decision)_ Confirm GitHub Copilot Code Review is enabled
  for this repository. The default `copilot-advisory` profile waits
  on Copilot review state; if Copilot is not enabled, migrate to the
  `external-bot` profile pointed at CodeRabbit.
